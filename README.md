### Introduction
<p> **What is skullstripping ?** Skull-stripping, belonging to one of the preprocessing step in neuroimaging analysis, aim to remove the non-brain tissues and leave the entire brain region.
<p> **What is Levelset method ?** The level set approach allows the evolving front to change topology, break, and merge, which means that the evolving front can extract the boundaries of particularly intricate contours. <https://math.berkeley.edu/~sethian/2006/Applications/Medical_Imaging/artery.html>
